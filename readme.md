## Blue Screen Screen Saver
### Yup

This will fill every monitor with a blue screen appropriately sized and positioned. That's right, even multi-monitor setups with varying dimensions and akward layouts.

The BSOD can be triggered via Hotkey (button press) or Hotstring (sequence of keypresses). This program will look for a file called "bsod.txt" for any alternate custom text to display.

See the script's info area at the top for configuration details.
